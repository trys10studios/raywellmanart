  <p class="backgroundColor">Hi, my name is Ray Wellman I am an oil painter focusing on painterly, loose brush, impressionist style artwork. I have always been a fan of impressionist artwork, or pushing the boundaries of what is considered art. I have an appreciation for all art styles, for me, this is my favorite. I enjoy focusing on light and color play, exaggerating or limiting colors in a piece.</p>

    <strong>Note: I use Gamblin Oils for my pieces, which are archival (meant to last), and are cured to the touch before sending.</strong>

  <p class="backgroundColor">As an artist, I am not doing this full time, I do have a "day job" but this job allows me to work and travel wherever and whenever I choose, and frees me up to paint when I want and when I feel. As such, I have been fortunate to travel to California in the Sierra National Forest for a few years during the summer working in a remote location and the Carolinas, where I spent a few months. I was born and raised - half of my childhood anyway - in Central Florida, the other half was spent in Eastern Kentucky in the Appalachian Mountains. I have spent a considerable amount of my life all over Florida, including Key West, FL. With all this travel, I have had the ability to experience many different settings, people, atmospheres, climates, and elevations. I don't just focus on landscape painting, I do animals, pets, people, whatever suits me at the time, but I would argue I have a forte for landscapes; they're sort of timeless.</p>
  
  <p>I love the old world feel of oil paint and it's forgiveness and flow as compared to say the more commonly used acrylics. The only downside to oils in my opinion; drying time. Which brings me to this point, I make sure the painting is "touch" dry, and I would caution you to let it hang on a wall (framed or otherwise) so that dust doesn't collect on it for a couple of months to be sure the painting is cured. When it has cured, it's ready to be varnished but be aware this isn't absolutely necessary. It all depends on where the oil painting is going to be placed, (e.g. in direct sunlight), or if it's in a dusty area or room. If you are not comfortable varnishing yourself, you could always bring it to a professional curator or framer.</p>
